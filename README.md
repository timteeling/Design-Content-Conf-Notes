# Design and Content Conference Notes

## Workshop - Responsive Web Design w/ Ethan Marcotte & Karen McGrane
- Skip links for mobile nav and search - solve separate nav issues. Show all nav
- Chop up page and force stakeholders to pick priority w/ post it notes for each chunk
- Overwhelming majority of people here say death to hero images
- pay more attention to mobile crops and serve hero images to mobile
- **Responsive design won't fix your content problem** - Karen
- **Performance is a content strategy problem** - Karen
- get content out of doc and pdf
- do NOT truncate from dev side

### Content modeling
- give content creators a structured doc to fill in w/ content
- specify fields, give limitations on word/character counts

### Content audit
- moving analogy -> don't move crap that you'd throw away
- DECIDE what's important
- User tests: have somebody read a few pages and take quiz or report back what main message(s) were
- NEEED an OWNER for content overall
- Rewrite, not necessarily redesign
- Write better. Write short declarative sentences
- Ask purpose, keep/get rid of, any duplication?, anything unnecessary?, how do you justify decisions?

### Responsive navigation
- don't rely on the hamburger
- dont' avoid the hard stuff
- check out progressive reveal (overflow drawer)
- look into toggles up/down arrows instead of hamburger
- look into skip links


### Content workflow
- google docs, [gather content](https://gathercontent.com/), [draft](https://draftin.com/) offer better collaboration and offer APIs to connect content to CMS


### Examples to look into and follow up on
- Capital One - components & design patterns
- Starbucks - style guide

### James White - Masters of the Universe
- Take a shot. reach out.
- No idea is too silly
- know your worth
- don't bite off too much
- jump at opportunities

### Kathy Wagner - Mapping content to customer journeys
- personas, customer journeys
- why arent they integrated into content correctly?
- No excuses, if its wrong you don't know HOW
- What is **purpose?** to inspire, entertain, educate, persuade, inform, signpost
- Topics: subject matter that interests your audience
- Messages: brand (emotional why do i want to do business / spend money )vs product (intellectural - how is this what I need?)
- Think concepts, NOT copy at first
- you need personas + customer journey + company
- awareness->research->decision making->support->advocacy
- What copy will support specific persona on their journey with the company?
- Assign a purpose to each stage of the journey
- Quick fix - Keep it high level and look @ all personas what are common truths and shared experiences
- Quick fix - Get specific, whats the main persona, stage, or content element
- Great examples from this presentation

### Haig Armen - Designing Mineblock: Merging the physical and digital
- Meta products are physical objects that have controllers, senses & actuators all connected to the cloud
- Basically IoT... Examples: Nest, Fitbit,
- Created Mineblock - Mindcraft hosted on a raspberry pi
- problems to overcome with IoT: UX and interface is hard to interact with a non native object
- Data, information, and privacy are all challenges
- Thinking by tinkering. (make to think, think to make)

### Tizzy Asher - content patterns that get heard in a noisy world
- what's not relevant is noise
- travel: everyone does it differently and is worried how much it costs
- how do you personalize at scale?
- assumptions are hard: business traveling vs vacation
- challenges: overwhelming at the amount of opinions, what's the right one for the users needs?
- infer carefully
- feedback on customer on boarding. Send emails and ask for feedback with simple questions to identify what works and what doesn't 

### Karen McGrane - Adaptive content context and controversy
- tailor content to device, context, person
Context: time, location, velocity, humidity, temperature 

## Sessions Day 2

### [Dana Chisnell](http://usabilityworks.com/) - Creative Mornings
- Design affects presidential election -> 2000 Bush/Gore ballot
- Big blunders: Healthcare.gov, mortgage crisis, 2004 election
- US Digital Service was formed to try to prevent these issues
- Good design keeps costs and support costs down in long term 

### Eileen Webb - Building a better authoring experience
- Why are you breaking my site? title lengths, text on images, contrast
- **Idea:** syntax highlighting for textareas for authors??
- Content guidelines, and who they are for
- Create them because too much is kept in your head
- look for repeating patterns in your content
- Balancing act -> write enough but not too much that its a burden to read
- Names give context -> try replacing title and body to give better context: ie Event Name, Event Description
- Try to reduce redundancy (if date is its own field, don't include it in teaser copy)
- Give image fields context and give options for art direction w/ multiple fields or tell more about crops
- Describe purpose of category and tag taxonomies and guide usage so no duplicates or similarites that are unneeded
- Nobody reads PDFs -> hard to version, hard to be accessible when you need it at a moments notice
- AX: author experience
- Build with people, not for people
- Add link to styleguide to edit screen in CMS

- choose outcomes over ego
- Ask teammate about their work and see what you learn
- customer needs feeling thinking doing
- take best idea off the table to see past preconceived notions 
- stop throwing things over the wall

### Parker McClean - Accessible user experiences
- Try looking at site with CSS turned off. 
- alt tags aren't that helpful to screen readers. Need to better orient user
- Skip links: skip to nav skip to content skip to footer

### Samantha Warren - Guerilla Design Tactics
- Design systems, not pages
- Organizational problems *are* design and content problems
- if you can't change it, change your attitude
- Think like a guerrilla: flexible, fast , and persistent
- don't wait for an invitation to do the work you want
- frameworks, tactics and tools
- framework: discover, analyze, execute, measure, iterate. tactics are strategies fore each phase
- flexibility for context
- to be impactful, you neeed to be flexible and resourceful under pressure
- there is no one way
- survey the landscape - ask questions to get background
- turn standard methods on their head: [story map](https://medium.com/design-story/story-map-3cc64033128e) & wireflow map
- make it feel real: prototypes
- speed limit story: just need to see speed limit sign, not jargon and long copy of the law
- speak the language, pay attention and find out what matters to the client
- persuasive persistence
- share: keynote to present and have a conversation. don't throw it over the wall

### Jared Spool - Is design metrically opposed?
- metrics vs your gut with design decisions
- what metrics are worth measuring? assumptions aren't necessarily worth it.
- metric is an observation, assumptions are inferences
- observation->inferences->design decision
- basic vs advanced search - there is only search
- don't stop at the first inference
- research tunrs inferences into observations
- Measure: something we can count. Metric: a measure we track. Analytics: A measure software tracks
- most analtyics are metric amplifiers - we can make the data tell any story
- GA can't tell you **why?**
- Converion rate can increase with a smaller audience and that is misleading especially when you care about revenue
- conversion rate assumes the person purchases on first visit. it also doesn't tell you **why?**
- achieving satisfaction is too low of a bar
- comparing data thats incomplete is pointless
- customer journey map: measure frustration to delight for every step of turning potential customer from first touch through their entire customer experience
- frustration comes from confusing content, incomplete info, hidden features, hidden nav, confusing nav
- customize analytics by **counting error message deliveries**
- qualitative usability research + quantitative custom metrics
- focus quantitative research on frustration
- continually question what the metric is trying to tell you
- design must drive the metric collection, not the other way around
- [Gallup CE11 survey](bit.ly/gallup-ce11)
- delight goes hand in hand with engagement
