- **Performance is a content strategy problem** - Karen
- get content out of doc and pdf

### Content modeling
- give content creators a structured doc to fill in w/ content
- specify fields, give limitations on word/character counts

### Content audit
- moving analogy -> don't move crap that you'd throw away
- DECIDE what's important
- User tests: have somebody read a few pages and take quiz or report back what main message(s) were
- NEEED an OWNER for content overall
- Rewrite, not necessarily redesign
- Write better. Write short declarative sentences
- Ask purpose, keep/get rid of, any duplication?, anything unnecessary?, how do you justify decisions?

### Responsive navigation
- don't rely on the hamburger
- dont' avoid the hard stuff
- check out progressive reveal (overflow drawer)
- look into toggles up/down arrows instead of hamburger
- look into skip links


### Content workflow
- google docs, [gather content](https://gathercontent.com/), [draft](https://draftin.com/) offer better collaboration and offer APIs to connect content to CMS
