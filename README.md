## Workshop - Responsive Web Design w/ Ethan Marcotte & Karen McGrane
- Skip links for mobile nav and search - solve separate nav issues. Show all nav
- Chop up page and force stakeholders to pick priority w/ post it notes for each chunk

- pay more attention to mobile crops and serve hero images to mobile
- **Responsive design won't fix your content problem** - Karen
- **Performance is a content strategy problem** - Karen
- get content out of doc and pdf
- do NOT truncate from dev side

### Content modeling
- give content creators a structured doc to fill in w/ content
- specify fields, give limitations on word/character counts

### Content audit
- moving analogy -> don't move crap that you'd throw away
- DECIDE what's important
- User tests: have somebody read a few pages and take quiz or report back what main message(s) were
- NEEED an OWNER for content overall
- Rewrite, not necessarily redesign
- Write better. Write short declarative sentences
